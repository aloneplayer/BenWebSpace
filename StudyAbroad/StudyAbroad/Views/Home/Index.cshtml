        How to study aboard</h2>
    <p>
        Study abroad takes planning to succeed. The sooner you starting preparing to study
        abroad, the better your experience will probably be. Start the process by following
        these steps: Meet with your Study Abroad or Academic Advisor: Each school has different
        policies for study abroad. Your school may even have different policies for different
        majors. Meet with your study abroad or academic advisor to discuss your interest
        in going abroad. Your advisor can help you understand how study abroad fits in with
        your academic plan Research Study Abroad Program: There are hundreds of study abroad,
        intern abroad, teach abroad, volunteer abroad and language abroad programs. Choose
        a program that fits your academic and personal goals for going abroad. See Choosing
        the Right Program Apply for Study Abroad Programs: Study Abroad Programs fill up
        quickly. Apply for two or three programs as soon as possible, or at least a few
        months prior to the application deadline. Review the application carefully. If your
        school is the program’s sponsor, see your study abroad advisor for specific application
        information. For all other programs, contact the program administrator directly
        for application questions and deadline.

                A 747 was halfway across the Atlantic when the captain got on the loud speaker,
                "Attention, passengers. We have lost one of our engines, but we can certainly reach
                London with the three we have left. Unfortunately, we will arrive an hour late as
                a r esult." Shortly thereafter, the passengers heard the captain's voice again,
                "Guess what, folks. We just lost our third engine, but please be assured we can
                fly with only one. We will now arrive in London three hours late." At this point,
                one passenger became furious. "For Pete's sake," he shouted, "If we lose another
                engine, we'll be up here all night!"
